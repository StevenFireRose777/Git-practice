            My name is Steven and I am a relatively new programmer in this software
            engineering thing. I am currently learning a lot of front-end stuff like
            HTML here and gonna learn CSS soon! I am planning to get better with GIT becasuse
            I always hear that Git is a great tool. And I think it is! However, I am lazy and 
            I need to do better. Anyways no more whining from me and Have a good day!
            <br>
